# A-CVAE-Based-Anomaly-Detection-Algorithm-for-Cyber-Physical-Attacks-on-Water-Distribution-Systems
web Based Machine Learning Project.
Designed a CVAE-based deep learning model to detect cyber-physical attacks in water systems. Key features
include low false alarms, quick detection, attack location identification, and recovery support. Achieved 98%
accuracy on benchmark datasets.
